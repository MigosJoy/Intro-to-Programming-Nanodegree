      <b>Components of the Web</b> <!-- A header for what will be covered in the first paragraph -->
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        The web is made up of several components: <b>Browers, Servers, the Internet,
        and a protocol called HTTP.</b> <em>Browers</em> make requests via the
        internet to servers using <em>HTTP</em> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
        <em>Servers</em> respond with files that the browser then displays. Servers
        are essentially just computers that host files rather than a traditional
        consumer laptop.

      <b>HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
      <p>
        Hyper Text Markup Language ("HTML") is made up of <b>Text Content</b>
        (what you <em>see</em>), <b>Markup</b> (what it <em>looks</em> like),
        references to other documents, and links to other pages. Most HTML Markup will
        typically include opening and closing tags that surround the <em>contents</em>.
        The entire line is known as the <em>element</em>. Certain aspects of Markup
        can give the contents "Attributes." For instance the <b>anchor</b> attribute
        creates links with whatever contents it is attributed to. Similarly, there is
        also an <b>image</b> attribute that displays the url to a picture for the user
        to see.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <b>Whitespace</b>
      <p>
        When writing HTML code it may become necessary at times to break up ideas. By
        default any whitespace written in the code is treated as only <b>one</b> space.
        Creating breaks can be done with two types of code: <b>Block</b> and/or
        <b>Inline</b>. Block breaks create a "block" around its contents. In
        comparison Inline creates a <em>new line</em> within the code while still being
        written on the same line as that code. An example of a Block tag would be
        <b>Paragraph</b>, which was used to create this webpage. An example of an Inline
        tag would be <b>Break</b>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOh9WjucNsA">This Video</a>
        does an excellent job at explaining. A key difference between paragraph and
        break is that break is known as "Void" while paragraph is not. A <b>Void</b>
        tag does not need a closing tag.

      <b>Chrome Developer Tools</b>
      <p>
        Chrome Developer Tools are usefool for web exploration and idea generation.
        In order to use Developer Tools one must download the Google Chrome application.
        Several other jelpful websites for learning to code: <b>LearnCPP, Treehouse,
        CodeAcademy, Learn Python the Hard Way, and Bash Tutorial</b>.

        <b>Visual Styling</b>
        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> are both programming languages. HTML represents
          the <em>structure</em> to Front-End Development, while CSS represents
          the <em>style</em>. CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. Each HTML
          Tag creates an element in the DOM (Document Object Model) that the Browser uses
          to display the page. The DOM is the tree-like structure of the webpage.
